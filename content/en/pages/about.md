I’m Yağız Demir, an M.A. student in Cognitive Science at Boğaziçi University. After earning a B.A. in Business Administration, my long-time fascination with technology and computer science pulled me toward Artificial Intelligence. Now I focus on NLP, especially how LLMs reason about time.

This blog is my learning log. Writing helps me reinforce new ideas, so you’ll see everything from ML basics to advanced stuff in NLP, plus some personal reflection when life gets interesting.
