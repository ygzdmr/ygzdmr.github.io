      * Error logs.
      * Session duration.

**2. Purpose and Legal Basis for Processing**

We use the collected Usage Data for the following purposes, based on our legitimate interests:

  * **App Improvement:** To understand how users interact with the App, identify areas for improvement, develop new features, and fix bugs.  This allows us to provide a better user experience.  Our legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in improving our product.
  * **Analytics:** To analyze trends in App usage and measure the effectiveness of our features. Our legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in understanding how our App is used.

**3. How We Collect Information**

We collect Usage Data automatically through the App as you use it. This data is collected using:

  * **Third-Party Analytics Services:** We use third-party analytics providers, specifically Mixpanel and Amplitude, to help us collect and analyze Usage Data. These services use their own technologies (like SDKs integrated into our app) to collect this information.  The data is anonymized before being sent to these services.

**4. Data Storage, Security, and Retention**

  * **Storage:** The Usage Data we collect is stored by our third-party analytics providers (Mixpanel and Amplitude) on their secure servers. *You should review their privacy policies for specifics on their data storage practices.*
  * **Security:** We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include using reputable third-party providers with strong security practices. *While you don't handle the data directly, it's important to state your commitment to security.*
  * **Retention:** We retain Usage Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (app improvement and analytics), or as required by law. *You should specify a reasonable retention period.  Consider something like "2 years," but research industry best practices and what Mixpanel/Amplitude recommend. You can also state that aggregated, anonymized data may be retained indefinitely.* For instance, "We retain Usage Data for a period of 2 years, after which it is deleted or further anonymized. Aggregated, anonymized data, which cannot be used to identify any individual, may be retained indefinitely."

**5. Data Sharing with Third Parties**

We share Usage Data with the following third parties:

  * **Mixpanel:** (Include a link to Mixpanel's privacy policy: [https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/)) We use Mixpanel for analytics purposes, as described above.
  * **Amplitude:** (Include a link to Amplitude's privacy policy: [https://amplitude.com/privacy](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://amplitude.com/privacy)) We use Amplitude for analytics purposes, as described above.

We do not share any information with any other third parties, including advertisers, payment processors, or social media platforms.
